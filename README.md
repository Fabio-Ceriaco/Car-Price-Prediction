# Car-Price-Prediction

Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Dataset: Car details v3.csv (Kaggle)
Objective: Predict the selling price of a car based on various features
This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models.
The dataset contains various features such as car name, year of manufacture, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, owner type, mileage, engine capacity, max power, and torque.
The selling price is the target variable to be predicted.
The models will be evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score.
The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately predict car prices based on the provided features.
